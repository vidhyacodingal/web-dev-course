            <h2>Flowers</h2>
            <p> A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants
                (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs â€“ sepals
                that enclose and protect the developing flower. These petals attract pollinators, and reproductive
                organs that produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce gametes. The male gametophytes,
                which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains produced in the anthers. The female gametophytes
                are contained within the ovules produced in the ovary.</p>

        <aside>
            <p>Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen
                between different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies,
                including brightly colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food
                source for pollinators.</p>
